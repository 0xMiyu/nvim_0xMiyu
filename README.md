## Miyu's Noobish Neovim Setup

My first attempt at customizing my own nvim setup, after multiple failed attempts at trying to switch to out-of-the-box solutions eg. Astro Nvim.

Special thanks to the following 2 videos for being my main inspiration and guidance: 

- [Devaslife's Neovim Setup](https://youtu.be/ajmK0ZNcM4Q)

- [ThePrimeagen's Neovim Nothing to LSP](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE)

Plugin List:

```bash
Coming Soon!
```
